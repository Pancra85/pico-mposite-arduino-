# pico-mposite

### Summary
The Pico-mposite Library but adapted for PlatformIO (Arduino).

Also now it works with double bitmap buffer and deleted the border so it draws on the whole screen.

This library lets you output VGA PAL or NTSC for the Raspberry Pico RP2040.

This output is compatible with AD724 IC (working in PAL and NTSC)
Only resolution available is 320x240 but I think could be easily modified.
