# pico-mposite

### Summary
The Pico-mposite Library but adapted for PlatformIO (Arduino).

Also now it works with double bitmap buffer and deleted the border so it draws on the whole screen.

This library lets you output VGA PAL for the Raspberry Pico RP2040.

This output is compatible with AD724 IC (working in PAL only at the moment)
Only resolution available is 320x240
